# 🌐 Understanding SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

## 🧩 What is SVG?

**SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. Unlike raster images (like JPEG or PNG), SVGs **don't lose quality** when scaled — making them ideal for web design, UI icons, logos, charts, and animations. They are also **easily styled with CSS and manipulated via JavaScript**, which gives developers and designers full control over visual rendering.
